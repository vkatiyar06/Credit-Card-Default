# Credit-Card-Default
# Problem
In recent years, the credit card issuers in Taiwan faced the cash and credit card debt crisis and the delinquency is expected to peak in the third quarter of 2006 (Chou,2006). In order to increase market share, card-issuing banks in Taiwan over-issued cash and credit cards to unqualified applicants. At the same time, most cardholders, irrespective of their repayment ability, overused credit card for consumption and accumulated heavy credit and cashâ€“card debts. The crisis caused the blow to consumer finance confidence and it is a big challenge for both banks and cardholders

# Approach
To apply different ML algorithms and to find which works best on this dataset.\
Data dosen't contain any NAN values. Irrelevant columns were removed from the data.\
Data is viualized using Seaborn.\
One hot encoding is done for categorical variables like 'marriage','education',etc.\
Feature Sacling is done for numerical varialbes in order to make all variable in range suitable for algorithms.\
Logistic Regression gives 82.5% accuracy with 0.432 F1 score.\
Stochastic Gradient Descent gives 81.33% accuracy with 0.377 F1 score.\
KNN gives 81.67% accuracy with 0.354 F1 score.\
SVM gives 80.67% accuracy with 0.301 F1 score.\
Decision Tree Classifier gives 73.1% accuracy with 0.3571 F1 score.\
Random Forest gives 81.33% accuracy with 0.391 F1 score.\
